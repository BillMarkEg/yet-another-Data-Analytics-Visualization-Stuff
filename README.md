## Data Foundation
#### Data can: 
1- information  -> meaningful eg. age is 27
2- raw data     -> have no meaning eg. (27) so is that an age , temp degre .. .. .. etc 

#### Benefits of Data: 
cheaper -> cost reduction & effeciency 
better -> gain new opp or build new product
smarter -> understand the market and customers so can make better decisions 

#### data formats 
structured  vs semi vs unstructured

#### what is database ?
less imp -> its storage where we save data into --- so why not just store it in a-file
most imp -> its a place where we collect data together to be (sharable-reliable-more secure - fast to retrieve and more .... )

#### data silos
its about the ** operational database** where accoundting db is **separate** from marketing and sales
and maybe **incompatible** too and each one has its **separate endpoint** to acess

so there is a concept of **datawarehouse** where all of this data is collected from all Rdbms and contain history of them for **BI**

#### schema
How our data is stored ?
eg. :id is pk |  age > 0 | name < 50 charachter

#### big data
volume, variety, velocity (growing so fast) and veracity(quality of it ).

#### data strategy
1-collecting data : what should we store now and what is better to store for the future | is there data we wanna scrape/buy/generate   
2-cleaning & preparing : deal with missing ,incomplete, duplicates  and wrong data
3-leverage & capitalize : how to gai value from it |  who can acess it | should we sell it/not  

#### data platform
GCP or AWS or cloudera ...etc
so here is how we evaluate who is better based on some feasures
1-**centralized authentification** (sso) sigle sign on so you sign in once to all systems you have acess to and not have to do it multiple times
2-**improved governence** better control,audit and logging 
3-**automated dashboards ** for KPIs
4-**data visualization** : charts, graphs and analyses
5-**data lake** : structred and unstructured (even not needed with no filteration)

## Big Data: The Big Picture
#### past vs now 
past -> trx data , keep what we need only , inclusive data (patent and closed source) , limited storage and limited scaling
now  -> behavioral , dont keep what is not needed (default to keep) , open source , cloud and limitless storage 

#### big data use cases
1-click web padge : a/b testing ,web ads and logs
2-IOT : most form of behavioral data not just trx
3-social media : tweets and posts
4-weather and sentiment analyses

#### data gravity on cloud
means the more data you move and replicate the more you pay $ and its hard to move/upload to cloud
